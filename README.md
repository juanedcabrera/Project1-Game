# Waldo's Great Escape 🏃

Waldo is tired of waiting to be found. He’s been on the run for quite some time and continues to be caught. Now he’s on the run and is moving through the crowded streets of New York City. You heard he was in broadway and are keeping your eye out in case you see him pass by you. He has many disguises now so it’s no longer just the red striped lanky guy with a beanie. Catch him and you win, don’t and he will be gone forever.



TLDR: Waldo/Wilma is designated at the top of the screen. You have 1 minute to find and click on the character. Once the timer is done if you haven’t found the character you’ll get a notification through an image. If you do you win and will get notified by an image.

## Tech Stack 💻

I plan on using:
- HTML 5 with Canvas
- Cascading Style Sheets
- Javascript


## MVP 🏆

- Start button to start the game
- Have rect boxes move from right to left
- Have rect boxes move from left to right
- Randomize the speed of which they show
- Designate one to be “Waldo” and put the image on the screen
- Create a hitbox on the Waldo image
- Detect a click on hitbox
- Put a timer that stops the game
- If Waldo is clicked within timer display winner image, if not loser image
- Write a rule/how to play section

## Stretch Goals ⭐
- Create image assets (I think I will use Open Peeps)
- Have images move slightly up and down to mimic walking
- Randomize the images
- Create a level system that loops next number and changes attributes
- Have higher number levels increase the rows and speed of which characters are moving
- Create a browser storing system that keeps track of player records so you could see past level achieved
- Have sounds that play for the crowd moving and when you click on Waldo

## Potential Roadblocks 🚧
- TIME! - Biggest worry is that I won’t have a completed game by next the deadline. 
- HitBox Click - We went over a hitbox to detect collision but not a click event
- Canvas - This project will use a many aspects of Canvas, a new language
- Math - There will be randomization pieces that will need to be created
- Audio - This will be something that is new to me and I’m not sure how it works
